        <ul>
            <li> <b>It’s easy to learn and use </b></li>
            When learning Bootstrap, you are playing by the rules set by other developers. You have to follow certain conventions and that makes learning Bootstrap a breeze.
            <li><b>Responsive features</b></li>
            Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops
            <li><b>Mobile-first approach</b></li>
             In Bootstrap, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework
            <li><b>Browser compatibility</b></li>
             Bootstrap 5 is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera).
            <li><b>It’s customizable</b></li>
            Bootstrap is easily customizable. You can adjust it to meet your needs and use it to create a unique website that looks great on any device, regardless of screen size or resolution. 
            <li><b>It has a huge community</b></li> 
            Bootstrap has a strong community behind it that continues to grow as more designers and developers use the framework for their projects. Due to its growing community, you have thousands of tutorials and articles to learn from.
            <li><b>It saves time</b></li>
            When you use Bootstrap in your web development projects, you're not creating a website from scratch. Instead, you are starting with a framework that contains all the basic elements needed for any type of website (navigation menus, modal windows, etc.).
            <li><b>Maintain Consistency</b></li>
            Bootstrap eliminates the use of libraries that always differ from one developer to the other. Thus, you get to maintain the stability of your project elements no matter who is tackling them.
